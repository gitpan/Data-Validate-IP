=head1 NAME

Data::Validate::IP - ipv4 and ipv6 validation methods

=head1 VERSION

version 0.15

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Data::Validate::IP qw(is_ipv4 is_ipv6);

  if(is_ipv4($suspect)){
        print "Looks like an ipv4 address";
  } else {
        print "Not an ipv4 address\n";
  }

  if(is_ipv6($suspect)){
        print "Looks like an ipv6 address";
  } else {
        print "Not an ipv6 address\n";
  }


  # or as an object
  my $v = Data::Validate::IP->new();

  die "not an ipv4 ip" unless ($v->is_ipv4('domain.com'));

  die "not an ipv6 ip" unless ($v->is_ipv6('domain.com'));

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module collects ip validation routines to make input validation,
and untainting easier and more readable.

All functions return an untainted value if the test passes, and undef if
it fails.  This means that you should always check for a defined status explicitly.
Don't assume the return will be true. (e.g. is_username('0'))

The value to test is always the first (and often only) argument.

All of the functions below are exported by default.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=over 4

=item B<new> - constructor for OO usage

  $obj = Data::Validate::IP->new();

=over 4

=item I<Description>

Returns a Data::Validator::IP object.  This lets you access all the validator function
calls as methods without importing them into your namespace or using the clumsy
Data::Validate::IP::function_name() format.

=item I<Arguments>

None

=item I<Returns>

Returns a Data::Validate::IP object

=back

=item B<is_ipv4> - does the value look like an ip v4 address?

  is_ipv4($value);
  or
  $obj->is_ipv4($value);

=over 4

=item I<Description>

Returns the untainted ip address if the test value appears to be a well-formed
ip address.

=item I<Arguments>

=over 4

=item $value

The potential ip to test.

=back

=item I<Returns>

Returns the untainted ip on success, undef on failure.

=item I<Notes, Exceptions, & Bugs>

The function does not make any attempt to check whether an ip
actually exists. It only looks to see that the format is appropriate.

=back

=item B<is_ipv6> - does the value look like an ip v6 address?

  is_ipv6($value);

=over 4

=item I<Description>

Returns the untainted ip address if the test value appears to be a well-formed
ip address.

=item I<Arguments>

=over 4

=item $value

The potential ip to test.

=back

=item I<Returns>

Returns the untainted ip on success, undef on failure.

=item I<Notes, Exceptions, & Bugs>

The function does not make any attempt to check whether an ip
actually exists. It only looks to see that the format is appropriate.

=back

=item B<is_innet_ipv4> - is it a valid ipv4 address in the network specified

  is_innet_ipv4($value,$network);
  or
  $obj->is_innet_ipv4($value,$network);

=over 4

=item I<Description>

Returns the untainted ip address if the test value appears to be a well-formed
ip address inside of the network specified

=item I<Arguments>

=over 4

=item $value

The potential ip to test.

=item $network

The potential network the IP must be a part of. Functionality uses Net::Netmask and should be in the form:

       '216.240.32.0/24'               The preferred form.

       '216.240.32.0:255.255.255.0'
       '216.240.32.0-255.255.255.0'
       '216.240.32.0 - 216.240.32.255'
       '216.240.32.4'                  A /32 block.

       '216.240.32'                    Always a /24 block.

       '216.240'                       Always a /16 block.

       '140'                           Always a /8 block.

       '216.240.32/24'
       '216.240/16'
       'default'                       0.0.0.0/0 (the default route)

       '216.240.32.0#0.0.31.255'       A hostmask (as used by Cisco
                                       access-lists).

Examples taken from Net::Netmask documentation.  For more advanced network matching needs please see Net::Netmask.

=item I<From RFC 5735>

   169.254.0.0/16 - This is the "link local" block.  It is allocated for
   communication between hosts on a single link.  Hosts obtain these
   addresses by auto-configuration, such as when a DHCP server may not
   be found.

=back

=item B<is_unroutable_ipv4> - is it a valid unroutable ipv4 address

  is_unroutable_ipv4($value);
  or
  $obj->is_unroutable_ipv4($value);

=item I<From RFC 5375>

   0.0.0.0/8 - Addresses in this block refer to source hosts on "this"
   network.  Address 0.0.0.0/32 may be used as a source address for this
   host on this network; other addresses within 0.0.0.0/8 may be used to
   refer to specified hosts on this network ([RFC1122], Section
   3.2.1.3).

   192.0.0.0/24 - This block is reserved for IETF protocol assignments.
   At the time of writing this document, there are no current
   assignments.  Allocation policy for future assignments is given in
   [RFC5736].

   198.18.0.0/15 - This block has been allocated for use in benchmark
   tests of network interconnect devices.  [RFC2544] explains that this
   range was assigned to minimize the chance of conflict in case a
   testing device were to be accidentally connected to part of the
   Internet.  Packets with source addresses from this range are not
   meant to be forwarded across the Internet.

   198.51.100.0/24 - This block is assigned as "TEST-NET-2" for use in
   documentation and example code.  It is often used in conjunction with
   domain names example.com or example.net in vendor and protocol
   documentation.  As described in [RFC5737], addresses within this
   block do not legitimately appear on the public Internet and can be
   used without any coordination with IANA or an Internet registry.

   203.0.113.0/24 - This block is assigned as "TEST-NET-3" for use in
   documentation and example code.  It is often used in conjunction with
   domain names example.com or example.net in vendor and protocol
   documentation.  As described in [RFC5737], addresses within this
   block do not legitimately appear on the public Internet and can be
   used without any coordination with IANA or an Internet registry.

   240.0.0.0/4 - This block, formerly known as the Class E address
   space, is reserved for future use; see [RFC1112], Section 4.

=item I<From RFC 4291>

   The unicast address 0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1 is called the loopback address.
   It may be used by a node to send an IPv6 packet to itself.  It must
   not be assigned to any physical interface.  It is treated as having
   Link-Local scope, and may be thought of as the Link-Local unicast
   address of a virtual interface (typically called the "loopback
   interface") to an imaginary link that goes nowhere.

=item I<From RFC 4291>

   An IPv6 multicast address is an identifier for a group of interfaces
   (typically on different nodes).  An interface may belong to any
   number of multicast groups.  Multicast addresses have the following
   format:

   |   8    |  4 |  4 |                  112 bits                   |
   +------ -+----+----+---------------------------------------------+
   |11111111|flgs|scop|                  group ID                   |

The function does not make any attempt to check whether an ip
actually exists.

=item I<From RFC 4291>

   Link-Local addresses are for use on a single link.  Link-Local
   addresses have the following format:

   |   10     |
   |  bits    |         54 bits         |          64 bits           |
   +----------+-------------------------+----------------------------+
   |1111111010|           0             |       interface ID         |
   +----------+-------------------------+----------------------------+

   Link-Local addresses are designed to be used for addressing on a
   single link for purposes such as automatic address configuration,
   neighbor discovery, or when no routers are present.

  is_special_ipv6($value);
  or

=item I<Returns>

Returns the untainted ip on success, undef on failure.

=item I<Notes, Exceptions, & Bugs>

The function does not make any attempt to check whether an ip
actually exists.

=item I<From RFC 2928>

   The block of Sub-TLA IDs assigned to the IANA (i.e., 2001:0000::/29 -
   2001:01F8::/29) is for assignment for testing and experimental usage
   to support activities such as the 6bone, and for new approaches like
   exchanges.

=back

The whole block of special IPv6 addresses can be written simple as 2001::/23.
